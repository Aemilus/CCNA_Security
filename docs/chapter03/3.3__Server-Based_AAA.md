Server-Based AAA
================
Introducing TACACS+ and RADIUS
------------------------------
`TACACS+`
- separates authentication and authorization
- encrypts all communication
- TCP port 49

Note: 
_TACACS+ is considered the more secure protocol._

Note: 
_TACACS+ is a Cisco enhancement of TACACS protocol and is incompatible with any previous versions of TACACS._

`RADIUS`
- combines authentication and authorization as one process
- encrypts only the password
- uses UDP port 1645 or 1812 for authentication and UDP port 1646 or 1813 for accounting
- supports 802.1X and SIP

Note:
_RADIUS is widely used by VoIP service providers._

Note: 
_A next-generation AAA protocol alternative to RADIUS is the DIAMETER AAA protocol._
