* Threat
	- potential for a vulnerability to turn into a network attack
	- includes malware, exploits and more
* Risk
	- the potential of a threat to exploit the vulnerabilities of an asset
	- risk is measured using the probability of occurence and its consequence

	- action of reducing the severity of the vulnerability

Vectors of Network Attacks
==========================

Cloud and Virtual Networks
==========================
Cloud computing separates the application from the hardware.
Virtualization separates the OS from the hardware.

Components of Cryptography
==========================
* Confidentiality
	- encryption
* Availability
	- backup
* Integrity
	- hashing
